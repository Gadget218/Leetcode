21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

 Example 1:
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Solution:

1. Initialize a dummy node and a tail to keep track of the last node of the output linked list.

2. Initiate a while loop, the loop will not end till either list1 or list2 is empty.

3. Within the loop comparison of each value of both the linked lists take place.

4. If the value of the node of list1 is less than that of the value of the node of list2 then list1's node is appended to the output list.

5. If the value of the node of list2 is less than that of the value of the node of list1 or equal then list2's node is appended to the output list.

6. If list1 gets emptied before list2 rest of list2 is appended to the output list but if list2 gets emptied before list1 rest of list1 is appended to the output list.

7. The output list is returned which is the merged list.
