1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

 

Example 1:

Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

Solution Python3 code:
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
    return [c + extraCandies >= max(candies) for c in candies]

Explanation:
1. [c + extraCandies >= max(candies) for c in candies]: This is the list comprehension syntax in Python. It iterates over each element c in the candies list and evaluates the expression c + extraCandies >= max(candies). The result is a list of boolean values.

2. c + extraCandies: It adds the variable extraCandies to each element c in candies. This calculates the total number of candies after adding the extra candies.

3. max(candies): It finds the maximum value in the candies list. This represents the maximum number of candies among all the elements in the list.

4. c + extraCandies >= max(candies): This expression compares the total number of candies after adding extraCandies to each element c with the maximum number of candies. It checks if the sum is greater than or equal to the maximum.

5. The result of the expression c + extraCandies >= max(candies) is a boolean value (True or False). The list comprehension collects these boolean values for each element c in candies, resulting in a list of booleans.

Time complexity is O(n).
