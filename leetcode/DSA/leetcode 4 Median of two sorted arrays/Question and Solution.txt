4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
 

Constraints:

nums1.length == m
nums2.length == n
0 <= m <= 1000
0 <= n <= 1000
1 <= m + n <= 2000
-106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106

Solution explanation using binary search:

A and B are initialized to nums1 and nums2 respectively.

total is initialized to the sum of the length of nums1 and nums2.

half is initialized to the floor division of total by 2.

If len(B) < len(A), then A and B are swapped.

l and r are initialized to 0 and len(A)-1 respectively.

A while loop is initiated with the condition True.

Inside the while loop, i is initialized to the floor division of the sum of l and r by 2. This represents the middle index of the A array.

j is initialized to half-i-2. This represents the middle index of the B array.

Aleft is initialized to the value at index i of A, or negative infinity if i is less than 0.

Aright is initialized to the value at index i+1 of A, or positive infinity if i+1 is greater than or equal to len(A).

Bleft is initialized to the value at index j of B, or negative infinity if j is less than 0.


Bright is initialized to the value at index j+1 of B, or positive infinity if j+1 is greater than or equal to len(B).

If Aleft <= Bright and Bleft <= Aright, then the median is found.

If total is odd, then the median is the minimum of Aright and Bright.

If total is even, then the median is the average of the maximum of Aleft and Bleft, and the minimum of Aright and Bright.

If Aleft is greater than Bright, then the search range is narrowed to the left of A.

Otherwise, the search range is narrowed to the right of A.

The while loop repeats until the median is found.
