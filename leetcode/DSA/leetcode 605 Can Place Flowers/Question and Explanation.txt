605. Can Place Flowers

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104
flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
0 <= n <= flowerbed.length

Solution:
The code adds two additional elements to the flowerbed list, a 0 at the beginning and the end. This is done to simplify the boundary conditions while iterating through the flowerbed list.

The code then iterates over the flowerbed list from index 1 to 'len(flowerbed)-2'. For each index, it checks if the previous, current, and next elements are all equal to 0. If they are, it means that a flower can be planted at that position. In that case, the code sets the current element to 1 to indicate that a flower has been planted and decrements the value of n by 1.

Finally, the code returns whether n is less than or equal to 0, indicating whether all the required flowers have been planted or not.
