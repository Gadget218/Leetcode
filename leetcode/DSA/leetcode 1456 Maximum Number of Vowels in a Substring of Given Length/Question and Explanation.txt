1456. Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length

Given a string s and an integer k, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of s with length k.

Vowel letters in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abciiidef", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring "iii" contains 3 vowel letters.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aeiou", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Any substring of length 2 contains 2 vowels.
Example 3:

Input: s = "leetcode", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: "lee", "eet" and "ode" contain 2 vowels.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= s.length

Solution Explanation:

The sliding window approach is used to solve this problem.

The code initializes a list vowel containing all the vowel characters. It also initializes three variables: l, cnt, and res to 0. l represents the left pointer of the sliding window, cnt stores the count of vowels in the current substring, and res keeps track of the maximum count of vowels encountered so far.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of s. In each iteration, it checks if the character at index r in s is a vowel. If it is, cnt is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. This step counts the number of vowels in the current substring.

After updating cnt, the code checks if the length of the current substring (r - l + 1) is greater than k. If it is, it means the current substring has exceeded the desired length k. In this case, the code checks if the character at index l (the leftmost character of the current substring) is a vowel. If it is, cnt is decremented by 1 to account for removing that vowel from the substring. The left pointer l is then incremented by 1 to slide the window to the right, excluding the leftmost character.

Next, the code updates res by taking the maximum value between res and cnt. This ensures that res always stores the maximum count of vowels encountered so far.

Finally, the code returns res, which represents the maximum number of vowels in any contiguous substring of s with a length of k.

Time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).
