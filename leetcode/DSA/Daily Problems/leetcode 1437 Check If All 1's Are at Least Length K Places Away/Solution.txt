class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        space=k
        for i in nums:
            if i==1:
                if space<k:
                    return False
                space=0
            else:
                space+=1
        return True

Explanation:
100101
once it starts it will set space to 0 then start counting space.
001001
Here once it reaches 1 then it will set space to 0 and then start counting space between 1s.

It is O(n) time complexity.
