class Solution:
    def findFinalValue(self, nums: List[int], original: int) -> int:
        num = set(nums)
        res = original
        while res in num:
            res*=2
        return res

Explanation:
Hash the input list and just look up the new value of res each times it gets multiplied by 2.
T: O(n), since converting to set is O(n) and looking up the values is constant time.
The set num stores all elements from nums so O(n) space.
