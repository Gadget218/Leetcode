class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count=0
        for i in nums:
            if i%3!=0:
                count+=1
        return count

Explanation:
If the number in list is not divisible by 3 then we have to either add or subtract 1 to make it divisible by 3. Hence, we simply count the number of elements not divisible by 3 in the list.
