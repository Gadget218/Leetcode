724. Find Pivot Index

Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.

The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.

If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.

Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The pivot index is 3.
Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,1,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The pivot index is 0.
Left sum = 0 (no elements to the left of index 0)
Right sum = nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + -1 = 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

Solution Explanation:
This solution iterates through the list of numbers, keeping track of the sum of elements to the left of the current index. It checks at each index if the sum of elements to the left is equal to the sum of elements to the right. 
If a pivot index is found, it returns the index. If no pivot index is found, it returns -1.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. The variable 'S' is initialized as the sum of all the elements in the nums list using the 'sum' function.

2. The variable 'leftsum' is initialized as 0, which will store the sum of elements to the left of the current index.

3. The code iterates over each element 'x' in the 'nums' list, along with its corresponding index 'i' using the enumerate function.

4. Inside the loop, it checks if the leftsum is equal to the sum of elements to the right of the current index '(S - leftsum - x)'. If they are equal, it means the current index 'i' is the pivot index, so it returns 'i' as the output.

5. If the condition in the previous step is not satisfied, it means the current index 'i' is not the pivot index. In this case, it adds the current element 'x' to the 'leftsum' to update the sum of elements to the left.

6. After the loop, if no pivot index is found, it returns -1 to indicate that there is no pivot index in the list.
