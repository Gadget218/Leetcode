Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.
 

Write an SQL query to report the managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| id  | name  | department | managerId |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| 101 | John  | A          | None      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| John |
+------+

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT name
FROM Employee
WHERE id IN
(SELECT managerId
FROM Employee
GROUP BY managerId
HAVING COUNT(id)>=5)

Explanation:

1. The subquery (SELECT managerId FROM Employee GROUP BY managerId HAVING COUNT(id) >= 5) retrieves the manager IDs from the Employee table. 
It groups the records by managerId and applies a HAVING clause to filter out the managers who have less than five employees reporting to them.

2. The main query SELECT name FROM Employee WHERE id IN (...) selects the name column from the Employee table for those employees whose id matches the manager IDs obtained from the subquery.
The IN keyword is used to compare the id values.

--OR--

SELECT e1.name FROM Employee e1 JOIN Employee e2 
ON e1.id=e2.managerId 
GROUP BY e1.id
HAVING COUNT(e2.managerID)>4;
