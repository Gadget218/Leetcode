177. Nth Highest Salary

Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write an SQL query to report the nth highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no nth highest salary, the query should report null.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
n = 2
Output: 
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+

SQL query explanation:
A function named "getNthHighestSalary" takes integer "N" as input and gives an integer as output.
The function decrements the value of "N" by 1.
The function then returns the result of a subquery that selects the distinct "Salary" value of the Employee table and orders them in the descending order based on salary. Skips the first N rows (i.e., the N-1 highest salaries) due to the "OFFSET N" Command, and returns the next row as the Nth highest salary( due to "LIMIT 1" command only one value is returned, if LIMIT command was not used all values after N would have been returned).
